SETUP
-----

1. Install Django
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/


2. Create your project.
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/


3. Get the source to Swoosh News.
git clone git://github.com/swooshnews/swoosh-news.git


4. Make symlinks from your project to the Swoosh News templates and app.

$ cd ~/some/path/to/your/project
$ ln -sf other/path/swoosh-news/news_app news
$ mkdir templates
$ cd templates
$ ln -sf other/path/swoosh-news/news_templates news


5. Make sure your urls.py is set up correctly.  Here is mine:

from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
urlpatterns = patterns('',
	(r'^', include('swoosh_news.news.urls')),
)

You will want to change 'swoosh_news' to whatever your project is called.


6. Make sure your settings are set correctly. Use my notes below and this page (http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/) to find appropriate values for these settings.

Here are the important lines of my `./manage.py diffsettings`

# error reports will go to this email address
ADMINS = (('username', 'email@example.com'),)

# This is used to extend the User model.
# (NOTE: this is not news.models.UserProfile, just news.UserProfile'
AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'news.UserProfile'

# Make sure these next two are set correctly.  You can find out how in the
# django documentation.
DATABASE_ENGINE = ...
DATABASE_NAME = ...


# These are all used for sending email.
EMAIL_HOST = 'your.host.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your_password'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your_username'
EMAIL_PORT = PORTNUM
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True


INSTALLED_APPS = ['django.contrib.auth', 
				  'django.contrib.contenttypes', 
				  'django.contrib.sessions', 
				  # this is the name of the news app referenced
				  # in step 4 and step 9.
				  'news',]

# this is the path to additional media (delt with in step 10)
MEDIA_ROOT = '/path/to/media/'
MEDIA_URL = 'http://www.example.org/media/'

# These are the addresses dealing with notifications on payment failures.
#
# This is the sending address.
NEWS_PAY_ERR_MAIL_FROM = 'swoosh.news.failures@gmail.com'  ###
# This is the address receiving payment errors.
NEWS_PAY_ERR_MAIL_TO = 'swoosh.news.pay.failures@gmail.com'  ###

# Your root url_conf
ROOT_URLCONF = 'your_project_name.urls'  ###

# This is the address that error messages will come from, 
# such as those sent to ADMINS and MANAGERS
SERVER_EMAIL = 'originating-email@example.com'

# The settings module for this project
SETTINGS_MODULE = 'your_project_name.settings'  ###

# These are the context processors you need.  The most important ones
# are auth, request, and settings.
TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = ('django.core.context_processors.auth', 
							   'django.core.context_processors.debug', 
							   'django.core.context_processors.i18n', 
							   'django.core.context_processors.media', 
							   'django.core.context_processors.request', 
							   'news.context_processors.settings')

# This refers to the template directory we created in step 4.
TEMPLATE_DIRS = ('/some/path/to/your/project/templates',)


7. Make sure your database is setup correctly in settings.py.

$ cd
$ mkdir your_project_database
$ cd ~/some/path/to/your/project
$ ln -sf ~/your_project_database


8. Install django-paypal.  You don't necessarily need to use
django-paypal, or accept payments at all, but decoupling it from the
rest of the Swoosh News code will take a little bit of hacking.

You can find out about django-paypal from the README here:
http://github.com/johnboxall/django-paypal/tree/master

The easier way to get and use django-paypal with this project is
to just put it inside your project directory.

$ cd ~/some/path/to/your/project
$ git clone git://github.com/johnboxall/django-paypal.git paypal

There is more detail in the django-paypal README, but you also need
to add a few additional items in your settings.py.

Add 'paypal.standard.ipn' to INSTALLED_APPS. So now INSTALLED_APPS
should look like this:

INSTALLED_APPS = ['django.contrib.auth', 
				  'django.contrib.contenttypes', 
				  'django.contrib.sessions', 
				  'news', 
				  'paypal.standard.ipn']

Also, add your Paypal receiver email.

PAYPAL_RECEIVER_EMAIL = 'your-recv-addr@example.com'
	

9. Make sure everything is on the PYTHONPATH.

First and foremost, the PYTHONPATH needs to be setup correctly for the
web server, otherwise nothing will work!

I added this to my django.wsgi (which the web server reads on startup):
sys.path.append('/home/youruser/some/path/to/your/django_projects')
sys.path.append('/home/youruser/some/path/to/your/django_projects/your_project')

You can find more information about django.wsgi here:
http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/IntegrationWithDjango


Also, you need the PYTHONPATH to be set correctly for your user, if you want
to be able to use init_db_vals.py and update_ranking.py from news_app/scripts/.
This can be done in your ~/.bashrc.  Just add something like this:

# add python path for your projects
if [ -d "$HOME/some/path/to/your/django_projects/" ]
then
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/some/path/to/your/django_projects/"
fi

# add a python path for paypal and the news app.
if [ -d "$HOME/some/path/to/your/django_projects/your_project/" ]
then
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/some/path/to/your/django_projects/your_project/"
fi


10. Install additional media. The templates for Swoosh News use 
additional media, such as CSS files.  These can be setup by 
symlinking the news_media directory under your basic media directory.

So, for instance, if your media directory is ~/path/to/media, you
would want to do this:

$ cd ~/path/to/media
$ ln -sf other/path/swoosh-news/news_media
